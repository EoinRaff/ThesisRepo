## Unreal Engine
1. Install Runtime Mesh Compnent (RMC)
1.1 Download .zip from github (for UE4.24, this [branch](https://github.com/gribuser/RuntimeMeshComponent) works)
1.2 In your Project directory, create a Plugins folder if it does not exist already (note this is NOT the plugins folder for the engine version)
1.3 Regenerate Visual Studio Project.

Examples of RMC: https://github.com/Koderz/RuntimeMeshComponent-Examples/blob/master/Source/RuntimeMeshExamples/SimpleExamples/BasicStaticProviderRMC.cpp
